# Host Management

## Hosts

[Video Overview of
Hosts](http://freeghost.sourceforge.net/videotutorials/hostinfo.html)

-   A host in FOG is typically a computer, but it can be any network
    device.
-   Hosts are used to identify a computer on the network and are used to
    manage the device.

## Adding a new host

[[storage-node#Adding a Storage Node]]

### Method 1: Adding a new host via Full registration

-   

    This is the preferred method, and maybe the easiest method for getting a host into the FOG database, but it requires you to visit the host.

    :   -   When at the client computer, during the boot up process when
            you see the PXE/iPXE boot menu select **Perform Full Host
            Registration and Inventory**.
        -   During this phase you will be prompted for information about
            the host like hostname, operation system, image, groups,
            Product Key, and other information.
        -   If you enter a valid operating system and image id, you will
            be asked to Image Now.
        -   If desired, you can set the task and it will deploy the
            image on the next network boot.

-   After the requested information is entered, FOG will pull a quick
    hardware inventory the client.

-   This method of registration will register the mac address(primary
    wired only), serial number(if available in BIOS), Make/Model, and
    other Hardware information with the FOG server.

-   For more information on these commands please see: [[using-fog-boot-menu#Client Side Tasks]]

### Method 2: Adding a new host via Quick Registration

-   Quick registration is very much like the Full host registration,
    with the exception that it will not prompt you for any input, nor
    give you the option to image the computer directly from the
    registration screen. When the host is added to the FOG server, it
    will be named with the hosts primary mac address. This method is
    great for adding a lab of 30 computers to FOG quickly and easily.
-   This feature is disabled by default, to enable this feature:

1.  Go to **FOG Configuration**

2.  Select **FOG Settings**

3.  Find section **FOG Quick Registration**

4.  Tick ON **FOG_QUICKREG_AUTOPOP** to &#10004;

5.  Set **FOG_QUICKREG_IMG_ID** to the image ID you would like to use
    for all newly created hosts.

6.  **FOG_QUICKREG_OS_ID** will be auto populated when "Save Changes"
    is selected. (OS is now associated within the image so no need to
    select an OS)

7.  

    Change **FOG_QUICKREG_SYS_NAME** to what you would like to name you new machines, where `*` will be replaced by a number.

    :   -   If you would like to zero pad numbers you can use
            **LAB300-**\*\* which would result with **LAB300-03** or
            **LAB300-09**.

8.  

    Set **FOG_QUICKREG_SYS_NUMBER** to the first number you would like to use.

    :   -   After each registration the computer will automatically
            image and the **FOG_QUICKREG_SYS_NUMBER** will incremented
            by 1.

### Method 3: Manually Adding

[Add Host Video
Tutorial](http://freeghost.sourceforge.net/videotutorials/addimghost.html)

-   Adding a new host can be done in the hosts section of FOG.
-   Then by clicking on the "Add New Host" button on the left hand
    menu.
-   At least a hostname and a MAC address must be entered in order to
    add the host to the FOG database.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### __Required__{ .red } Fields

A host consists of the following __Required__{ .red } Fields:

##### Hostname

> A string used for the Windows Hostname of client, this must be less
> than 15 characters long.

##### MAC address

> This field is used in for for a unique identifier for the host. The
> string must be separated by `:` (colon), in the format of
> `00:11:22:33:44:55`.

> [!NOTE]
> The MAC Address has a description field. This can currently only be set via the api and can be whatever you want it to be. 
> For example you could use the [FOGApi powershell module](https://github.com/darksidemilk/FogApi) to set the mac descriptions to the make/model of the adapter like so

```
$fogHost = Get-FogHost
$fogHostMacs = Get-FogHostMacs -hostid $foghost.id;
$fogHostMacs | ForEach-Object {
    $fogmac = $_;
    $netAdapter = Get-NetAdapter -IncludeHidden | Where-Object macaddress -eq $fogmac.mac.replace(":","-");
    if ($Null -ne $netAdapter) {
        $fogMac.description = "$($netAdapter.name) - $($netAdapter.InterfaceDescription)"
        Update-FogObject -type object -coreObject macaddressassociation -jsonData ($fogMac | convertto-json) -IDofObject $fogmac.id -vb
    }
}
```

This does a POST to `{fogurl}/fog/macaddressassociation/{macID}/edit` with a json formatted like the following for each mac address on a windows machine that already exists in FOG.

```
{
  "id": 6355,
  "hostID": 1847,
  "mac": "f4:a4:75:ab:93:d4",
  "description": "Wi-Fi - Intel(R) Wi-Fi 6E AX210 160MHz",
  "pending": "0",
  "primary": "0",
  "clientIgnore": "0",
  "imageIgnore": "0"
}
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Optional Fields

Hosts can also include, but are not required:

##### Description

> Information for your own reference.

##### Image Association

> This field is a drop down box that will allow you select an image
> object created in the **Images** section.

##### Operating System

> Drop down box that allow you to select the primary type of operating
> system running on this host.

##### Kernel

> This is only used if you want to overwrite the default kernel used for
> FOG. Needs to be specified as fog/kernel/mybzImage

##### Kernel Arguments

> This allows you to add additional kernel arguments for booting the
> host (ie: vga=6, or irqpoll).

##### Primary Disk

> This option allows you to force a device to use during imaging if fog
> fails to detect the correct device node.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

!!! note

    This page also allows for configuration of Active Directory integration,
    but this topic will be covered later.


**When all settings are added, click on the "Add" button.**

### Method 4: Importing Host Information

-   When getting started with FOG, you need to enter the host
    information for the devices on your network. We understand this can
    be a long difficult process, so in order to make this process easier
    we created a page that allows you to import most of the host
    information from a CSV file.
-   The CSV file that is imported to FOG must be in the following
    format, and the file should not have a header row.

`MAC Address,Host name,Description,OSID,ImageID`

-   The **MAC Address** [required]{.red} is the NIC's MAC address
    seperated by `:` (colon).
-   The **Host name** [required]{.red} is the computer's Host name
    (must be less than 15 characters, should not include underscores,
    according to \[<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc952> \| Network
    Working Group \]).
-   The **'Description** [Can be Left as Blank]{.orange} is any text
    description you would like associated with the computer.
-   The **OSID** [required]{.red} is the number representing the
    operating system. It can be found in the table "supportedOS" in
    the field osID.
-   The **ImageID**[required]{.red} is the number representing the
    images file linked to this image. The image definition must already
    exist and this number can be found in the table "images" in the
    field imageID.

!!! warning

    The file must be saved as a CSV **without** a header row.


Sample:

    00:00:02:AF:00:E0:01:0F,adminoff1,10.0.1.150,Main admin office computer,5,14
    00:00:02:AF:00:E0:01:04,adminoff2,,admin office 2 computer,5,13
    00:00:02:AF:00:E0:01:02,adminoff3,,,5,12

#### Importing the File

1.  After the file is prepared and saved, you will need to log into the
    FOG Management Portal.
2.  Then click on the Hosts icon .
3.  On the left-hand menu, click on **Import Hosts**.
4.  Browse for your file, then click "**Upload CSV**".

#### Create CSV From Network Scan

Per a community user in the forums. You can also use powershell to scan
the network and create a csv. See [Creating a csv host import from a
network
scan](https://forums.fogproject.org/topic/9560/creating-a-csv-host-import-from-a-network-scan?_=1602530061175)

``` {.powershell emphasize-lines="3,12"}
# examples, just gotta put subnets minus the final .x in a string array
# Could also be params if this was a function
$subnets = @("192.168.1", "192.168.2", "10.2.114", "192.168.0"); 
$subnets | ForEach-Object { # loop through each subnet
    for ($i=0; $i -lt 255; $i++) { # loop through 0 to 255 of the subnet
        $hn = nslookup "$_.$i"; # run nslookup on the current ip in the loop
        if ($hn[3] -ne $null -AND $hn[3] -ne "") { # does the ip have a dns entry
            $hostN = $hn[3].Replace("Name:","").Trim(); # parse the nslookup output into a fqdn host name
            $mac = getMac /S $hostN; # does the hostname have a mac addr. Can also add /U and /P for user and password if not running from a administrative account
            if ($mac -ne $null) { # was there a mac for the host?
                $macAddr = $mac[3].Split(' ')[0]; # use the first found mac address and parse it
                "$hostN,$macAddr" | Out-File C:\hosts.csv -Append -Encoding UTF8; # add the hostname,macaddress to the csv
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Managing Hosts

### General

-   Once hosts have been added to the FOG database you can modify or
    delete them. Finding a host which you wish to edit can be done in
    two ways, the first is by listing all the hosts that exist. This is
    done by clicking on the "List All Hosts" button. The second way to
    locate a host is to use the search function. To search for hosts
    click on the "New Search" button, if you would like to search for
    all hosts you can enter a "\*" or "%". The search function will
    search in the host's name, description, IP and MAC address.
-   Once a host is located, it can be edited by clicking on the edit
    button or on the Host Name itself. Clicking on the edit button will
    display all the properties that were shown during host creation with
    the addition of snapin, printers, active directory, service
    settings, hardware, virus history, and login information.
-   The entire host object can be removed from the FOG system by
    clicking on the delete option at the bottom of the Host Menu.

### Multiple MAC Address Support

-   When FOG first registers your HOST computer it uses the first
    connected Ethernet cable and defaults it to the Primary MAC Address.
    Once the FOG Client is installed and reporting data back to the FOG
    server it may register other additional MAC addresses, such as
    wireless and other wired connections. Also, an additional MAC can
    also be added directly under the Host definition.

-   

    These new MAC Addresses will need to be approved before FOG will take advantage of them.

    :   1.  **Host Management** \-:octicons-arrow-right-24: **\[Selected Host\]**
            \-:octicons-arrow-right-24:*Additional MAC*
        2.  **Fog Configuration** \-:octicons-arrow-right-24: **MAC Address List**
            \-:octicons-arrow-right-24:*Approve Pending Addresses*

-   **Fog Configuration** \-:octicons-arrow-right-24: **MAC Address List** At this location
    you can also *"Update Current Listings"* giving updated
    information on the MAC Addresses and their manufactures, listing it
    under the Host.

### Host Status

-   Host Status displays an indicator icon next to the host within the
    FOG UI showing the status of the machine. This function executes a
    ping based on the host's name. So in order for this to work you
    must have an internal DNS server that is tied in with your DHCP
    server, so that when a DHCP address is given out, the DNS server is
    notified with the new IP. If that is setup correctly, you must make
    sure your FOG server is able to ping a host from the command line
    using:

        ping somehostname

-   If the server isn't able to ping the client, then the status of the
    host in the UI with always show as unreachable. If you can ping the
    client using the FQDN, like:

        #Replace forproject.org with your domain suffix
        ping somehostname.fogproject.org 

-   Then you will need to adjust the DNS **Search domains:** setting on
    your sever. After making this change you will need to restart the
    apache server for it to take affect.

-   If after this, you still can't ping your clients, the problem may
    be due to a firewall issue with the clients. In this case, client
    specific configuration changes might be needed.

-   

    With an increase in Hosts(250+) this "ping" will delay the loading of the List *All Hosts* page. Disabling this feature will help in loading this page.

    :   1.  **Fog Configuration** \-:octicons-arrow-right-24: **Fog Settings** \-:octicons-arrow-right-24: **General
            Settings** \-:octicons-arrow-right-24: Untick *FOG_HOST_LOOKUP*

### Creating Host Groups

-   FOG allows you to create groups of hosts which then allows you to
    take action on a whole grouping of hosts.
-   Hosts can be created either on the "List All Hosts" section or by
    doing a search for hosts.
-   To create a group select the computer you would like to be member of
    the group by placing a check in the box next to the hostname, or by
    clicking the check all button in the title row. After the hosts are
    selected scroll to the bottom of the screen and then enter a name in
    the create to group box or select a group to add the hosts to. Then
    click on the "Process Group Changes" button.
