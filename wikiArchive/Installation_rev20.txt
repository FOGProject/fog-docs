== Requirements ==
Before diving right into the installation of FOG you need to decide which server OS you are going to use. FOG is made to install on RedHat based distro CentOS, Fedora, RHEL amongst others as well as Debian, Ubuntu and Arch Linux. Choose whichever you like most and have knowledge about! FOG is known to work with any of the above noted systems. Many [[Installation#Installation_manuals|installation manuals]] are available.

This listing is for informational purposes only, as the required components will be automatically downloaded and installed by the FOG installation script: PHP 5/6/7, MySql 5+, Apache 2+, DHCP (any!), TFTP, FTP, NFS

The LAMP setup can also be easily adjusted for a "WAMP (Windows Apache MySQL PHP) system" though will require a bit more knowledge of what packages to use and how to integrate with the FOG system.

Please choose the distribution you have the most knowledge about, but the below list has the best support in FOG 1.3.0 right now. This list is by no means an absolute list to follow, though.

*  Ubuntu 14 or higher

* Debian 8 or higher

* Red Hat 6 or higher

* Fedora 22 or higher

* Any version of Arch.

== Download FOG ==

=== Official release ===
FOG was first hosted on the well known open source project platform SourceForge and you still find the current code plus released versions [[https://sourceforge.net/projects/freeghost/ there]] (download as well linked on the [[https://fogproject.org/ official homepage]]. You'll get a comressed tar archive (.tar.gz) which you need to extract (anywhere is ok) before you can run the installer script ('''root privileges needed!''').

 sudo -i
 wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/freeghost/FOG/fog_1.2.0/fog_1.2.0.tar.gz
 tar xzf fog_1.2.0.tar.gz
 cd fog_1.2.0/bin
 ./installfog.sh

=== Current development version ===
{{:Upgrade_to_trunk}}

== Installer ==
The FOG installer comes as a complex shell script that will handle all the package installs and configuring the services for you. It must be run as root (sudo works as well) to be able to set things up properly. Running the installer on a new system for the first time it will ask you a couple of questions regarding your network configuration and services you want to install.

=== Modes ===
FOG can be installed in two different modes. First is the normal FOG server which does all of the work. Choose this option if you only want have a single FOG server in your network. The second option is to install a FOG storage node which will serve as a second place to store images on and serve images to more clients (when doing unicast). [[InstallationModes|Here]] you can find some more information about the two modes.

   FOG Server installation modes:
       * Normal Server: (Choice N) 
           This is the typical installation type and
           will install all FOG components for you on this
           machine.  Pick this option if you are unsure what to pick.
 
       * Storage Node: (Choice S)
           This install mode will only install the software required
           to make this server act as a node in a storage group

=== Command line options ===
The FOG installer has quite a few command line options. See the output below. You might want force FOG to setup the web interface via HTTPS, change the default PXE boot file or web root directory.

== Virtualization ==
FOG can be used on bare metal as well as in most virtual server and client setups. Some of the virtualization techniques are really great when used with FOG, e.g. snapshots. Some people use virtualization to prepare and upload their "golden (master) images" all on one central location/server. Again like with the server OS we don't prefer any of the following or others that are out there. This is only a collection of hints and tricks plus maybe issues we know about.

=== Hyper-V ===

'''Using the New VM Wizard:'''

Ensure the virtual switch your VM is connected to has a route to FOG!

Create VM Wizard > Installation Options: Select "Install an operating system from network-based installation server"


'''Existing VM:'''

Ensure the virtual switch your VM is connected to has a route to FOG!

Right click VM > Settings > BIOS

Move "Network Adapter" (sometimes labeled "Legacy Network Adapter") to the top of the boot order.


'''UEFI:'''

UEFI/Secure Boot is an option with Hyper-V on Server 2012 on Generation 2 VMs. It is enabled by default, and can be disabled in VM Settings -> Firmware: Uncheck secure boot.

Thanks to [https://forums.fogproject.org/user/moses moses]

=== KVM/QEMU ===
Can be used as kind of a lightweight desktop virtual environment to test FOG and master your images.
Using this on the laptop as local test environment. Search forums and wiki but there is no valuable information about anyone using FOG on a KVM server. Asked user mxc as he seams to use it. Otherwise this will be a brief description on how to use this as I do it.

 # setup network tap device as kind of a local software switch to connect it all
 sudo tunctl -t tap0 -u <username>
 sudo ifconfig tap0 x.x.x.x netmask 255.255.255.0 up
 
 # generate disk image file
 qemu-img create -f qcow2 hd.qcow2 10G
 
 # start VM using QEMU emulator (BIOS mode)
 qemu -m 512 -boot n -net nic,vlan=1 -net tap,vlan=1,ifname=tap0,script=/bin/true -hda hd.qcow2
 
 # start VM using real KVM virtualization (BIOS mode)
 kvm -m 512 -boot n -net nic,vlan=1,macaddr=00:00:00:00:00:05 -net tap,vlan=1,ifname=tap0,script=/bin/true -hda hd.qcow2
 
 # start VM as UEFI machine - as well using the more modern '-netdev' parameter
 kvm -m 512 -boot n -bios /usr/share/ovmf/OVMF.fd -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=hn0 -netdev tap,id=hn0,ifname=tap0,script=/bin/true -hda hd.qcow2

=== OpenVZ ===
OpenVZ (possibly within Proxmox) is mostly used to run the FOG server in a light weight kind of virtual environment. As OpenVZ is in nature similar to a chrooted environment you cannot actually PXE boot such a container. To install FOG as a server in OpenVZ you need to have NFS support on the host machine first and then add it to the container as well:

 $ lsmod | grep nfsd
 nfsd                  312315  14
 $ grep nfsd /proc/filesystems
 nodev   nfsd

If you don't see the kernel module ''nfsd'' loaded you might need to install the nfs-kernel-server package and load the module (usually done by the nfs-kernel-server init script). As mentioned before you need to enable access to ''nfsd'' from within the container you want to install FOG to:

 $ vzctl stop $CONTAINER_ID
 $ vzctl set $CONTAINER_ID --feature  nfsd:on --save
 $ vzctl start $CONTAINER_ID

After that the installer should run through like it would installing on bare metal or any other virtual environment!

'''Wake on LAN:'''

To be able to send WOL and multicast packages the container needs a proper MAC address. This is only the case if you configure the container to use a network bridge (veth instead of venet!).

=== VirtualBox ===
Bridged network, host only. Older versions have (PXE?) bug - Tom knows about that.

Have we seen this issue in the FOG forums yet? http://forum.ipxe.org/showthread.php?tid=7864

=== VMWare ESXi ===
Running a FOG client within an ESXi server is pretty close to what you would do on a bare metal machine:

* Create VM as normal.
* Choose network adapter other than VMX3 (e.g. e1000) as we have seen [https://forums.fogproject.org/topic/7108/fog-bzimage-failing-to-load-after-pxe-boot loading issues] with those virtual adapters.
* Open VM Console, start up the VM. Press F2 on Boot Logo to enter BIOS.
* Scroll over to boot tab, use + key to move Network boot to the top of the boot order.

You can also do an on-demand network boot by hitting F9 on startup, if you don’t want to change the boot order permanently.

'''UEFI:'''

UEFI is disabled by default for VMs in ESXI 6.0+. To enable it for a VM, go to VM Settings > Options Tab > Advanced: Boot Options and change the boot firmware from BIOS to EFI.

=== VMWare Player ===
Is this still in use?? Don't care if there is nothing about it in wiki or forums!

=== Xen/XenServer ===
