Quartz features a graph-view that can show both a local graph view and a global graph view.

- The local graph view shows files that either link to the current file or are linked from the current file. In other words, it shows all notes that are _at most_ one hop away.
- The global graph view can be toggled by clicking the graph icon on the top-right of the local graph view. It shows _all_ the notes in your graph and how they connect to each other.

> [!info]
> The Graph View is now a community plugin. This demonstrates how external plugins can extend Quartz functionality while serving as a reference implementation for plugin developers.

## Installation

The Graph View is available as a community plugin from GitHub:

```bash
npm install github:quartz-community/graph --legacy-peer-deps
```

Then add it to your `quartz.config.yaml`:

```yaml title="quartz.config.yaml"
plugins:
  - source: github:quartz-community/graph
    enabled: true
    layout:
      position: right
      priority: 10
```

## Features

By default, the node radius is proportional to the total number of incoming and outgoing internal links from that file.

Additionally, similar to how browsers highlight visited links a different colour, the graph view will also show nodes that you have visited in a different colour.

> [!info]
> Graph View requires the `ContentIndex` emitter plugin to be present in the [[configuration]].

## Customization

Most configuration can be done by passing in options to `Graph()`.

For example, here's what the default configuration looks like:

```yaml title="quartz.config.yaml"
plugins:
  - source: github:quartz-community/graph
    enabled: true
    options:
      localGraph:
        drag: true
        zoom: true
        depth: 1
        scale: 1.1
        repelForce: 0.5
        centerForce: 0.3
        linkDistance: 30
        fontSize: 0.6
        opacityScale: 1
        removeTags: []
        showTags: true
        enableRadial: false
      globalGraph:
        drag: true
        zoom: true
        depth: -1
        scale: 0.9
        repelForce: 0.5
        centerForce: 0.3
        linkDistance: 30
        fontSize: 0.6
        opacityScale: 1
        removeTags: []
        showTags: true
        focusOnHover: true
        enableRadial: true
    layout:
      position: right
      priority: 10
```

When passing in your own options, you can omit any or all of these fields if you'd like to keep the default value for that field.
