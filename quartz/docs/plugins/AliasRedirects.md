This plugin emits HTML redirect pages so that old URLs redirect to the canonical page. It handles two types of redirects:

1. **Frontmatter aliases**: Redirect pages for aliases defined in your content's frontmatter.
2. **Case-preserving redirects**: Automatic redirect pages for URLs that changed due to Quartz v5's lowercase slug normalization.

### Frontmatter Aliases

If `foo.md` has the following frontmatter:

```md title="foo.md"
---
title: "Foo"
aliases:
  - "bar"
---
```

The target `host.me/bar` will be permanently redirected to `host.me/foo`.

The emitter supports the following frontmatter fields:

- `aliases`
- `alias`

### Case-Preserving Redirects

Quartz v5 normalizes all URLs to lowercase. If you are migrating from v4 (which preserved the original casing), previously indexed URLs containing uppercase letters (e.g. `/Diary/My-Note`) would return 404 errors.

When `enableCaseRedirects` is enabled (the default), this plugin automatically detects files whose original path differs from the lowercased slug and generates redirect pages at the original-case URL. For example, if your content directory contains `Diary/2026-01-01.md`, the plugin generates:

- The canonical page at `/diary/2026-01-01` (produced by the normal build)
- A redirect page at `/Diary/2026-01-01` (produced by this plugin)

The redirect page includes proper SEO signals:

- `<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=...">` for an instant redirect
- `<link rel="canonical">` pointing to the lowercase URL
- `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` to prevent duplicate indexing

This preserves search engine rankings and ensures inbound links continue to work.

> [!note]
> Case-preserving redirects have no effect on case-insensitive filesystems (macOS, Windows) where the server already resolves either casing to the same file. The plugin automatically detects the filesystem type and skips redirect generation when unnecessary.

This plugin accepts the following configuration options:

- `enableCaseRedirects`: If `true` (default), automatically generates redirect pages for URLs that changed casing due to v5's lowercase normalization. Set to `false` to disable this behavior.
